Phase one: Given some bitmap lookup table, print out some letters in bitmap format.
I.E # This is an example bitmap of the letter "J"

Phase two: compression and decompression on the lookup table, print out the same letters
Phase three: some additional manipulation on the lookup table, print out the same letters. 
This should reuse part of phase two code.
起手就给了你写好的map, 让你打印字. 然后让你打印一句话, 每行有长度限制，超长的话要分行
