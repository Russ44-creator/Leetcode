'''
Given a 2D matrix where some of the elements are filled with 1 and the rest of the 
elements are filled with X, except 2 elements, of which one is S (start point) 
and E (endpoint). Here X means you cannot traverse to that particular point.
From a cell you can either traverse to left, right, up or down. Given two points in 
the matrix find the shortest path between these points.
For example, if the matrix is
1 1 1 1 1
S 1 X 1 1
1 1 1 1 1
X 1 1 E 1
1 1 1 1 X


One of the shortest paths (from E to S both exclusive) is: [(3, 2), (3, 1), (2, 1), (2, 0)]. 
Return null if there is no path between S and E.
